 10:50pm – 12:20pm   Conclusion of Tutorial

Welcome to my PyCon tutorial,
which is now in its fourth year at PyCon.
Sphinx has come a long way since this tutorial was first offered
back on a cold February day in 2010,
when the most recent version available was 0.6.4.
Sphinx has now reached 1.1.3,
and I have worked to keep this tutorial up to date
with all of the most recent features in Sphinx.
I hope you enjoy it with me!
